              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Sometimes the best songs come from the worst moments. "Cry A Little Louder" was born from one of those 
                nights when you're scrolling through old photos, feeling sorry for yourself, and then suddenly you get 
                angry – not at them, but at yourself for wasting time being sad. That's when I knew I had to write 
                something fierce, something that would make me feel powerful again.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This isn't your typical sad breakup song. From the very first line, "Cry A Little Louder" is about 
                flipping the script. Instead of wallowing, it's about rising up. Instead of begging someone to stay, 
                it's about showing them what they lost. The song is catchy, bold, and completely unapologetic – 
                exactly how I felt when I was writing it.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">From Heartbreak to Empowerment</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The writing process was incredibly cathartic. I started with the hook – "Go ahead and cry a little 
                louder, I'm already moving on" – and everything else flowed from there. It's about that moment when 
                you realize you're worth so much more than someone who doesn't see your value. It's about glowing up, 
                not just physically but emotionally and mentally.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Working with my incredible production team, we wanted to create a sound that matched the energy of the 
                lyrics. The beat is driving and confident, with pop elements that make you want to dance rather than cry. 
                Every element of the production was designed to make you feel empowered, from the punchy drums to the 
                soaring chorus that builds to an explosive release.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Power of Moving On</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                At 17, I've learned that heartbreak doesn't have to break you – it can make you stronger. "Cry A Little 
                Louder" is my anthem for anyone who's ever felt undervalued in a relationship. It's about recognizing 
                your worth and not being afraid to walk away from situations that don't serve you.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The song is also about growth. Every relationship, even the ones that end badly, teaches us something 
                about ourselves. This track celebrates that growth and the confidence that comes from knowing you can 
                handle whatever life throws at you. It's about being fierce, being bold, and never apologizing for 
                taking up space.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">A New Chapter</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                "Cry A Little Louder" represents a new chapter in my music and my life. It's bolder, more confident, 
                and more unapologetically me than anything I've released before. The response from fans has been 
                incredible – so many people have told me it's exactly what they needed to hear.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
                This song is for everyone who's ever been told they're "too much" or "too emotional." It's for anyone 
                who's ever had to rebuild themselves after someone else tried to tear them down. Most importantly, 
                it's a reminder that your voice matters, your feelings are valid, and sometimes the best revenge is 
                simply living your best life. So go ahead – cry a little louder, then get up and show the world 
                what you're made of.
